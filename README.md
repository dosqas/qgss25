# ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum Computing Labs ‚Äì QGSS 2025

## üéâ Introduction

Welcome to my collection of quantum computing labs and assignments completed during the **Qiskit Global Summer School 2025 (QGSS)**.

Before joining QGSS, I participated in the **Road 2 Practitioner** program organized by **IBM Quantum** and the **Freeya Mind Campus** teams, which helped me build a strong foundation in quantum concepts and Qiskit.

Thanks to the incredible learning resources, guidance, and community provided by the **IBM Quantum team**, this has been an inspiring and highly educational journey. QGSS 2025 allowed me to explore advanced quantum topics, implement algorithms on simulators, study error mitigation, and even work on quantum chemistry problems, leaving me far more confident in my quantum computing abilities.
